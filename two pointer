two pointer approch
sliding window
both are quiet similar 
generally they are used in array/string questions in which you take two pointers pointing to some position of that collection and than solving it accordingly.
this approch is used generally to reduce the time complexcity of code generally O(n).
for ex:-target sum..in sorted array
        three sum
        four sum
        longest mountain subarray
          ->start pointer and a movable pointer(first increasing then decreasing)(j-i+1)
        container with most water  
        remove consecutive duplicates from string
        is subsequence
          ->map<char,int> mp (string1)
          ->iterate over string 2;
